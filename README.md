# Sleep scoring: A performance assessment for Wavelets as feature extractor and Random Forest as classifier evaluating different ages and early-late sleep

Sleep classification is a common method used by experts to monitor the quantity and quality of people's sleep, but it is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task with high inter- and intra-observer variability. Starting from wavelets as a feature extractor, and random forest as a classifier, an automatic sleep stage classification method was sought and assessed. The age of the subjects, as well as early and late sleep does affect the automatic model performance, improving the classification of some sleep stages and worsening others. Therefore, the model to be used will depend in part on the target to be classified.
